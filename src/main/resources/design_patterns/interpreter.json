      "correctAnswers": ["Managing data persistence"],
      "incorrectAnswers": ["Interpreting expressions based on context", "Defining the grammar of a language", "Parsing a sequence of commands"],

    {
      "question": "In which case is the Interpreter Design Pattern generally not a good fit?",
      "correctAnswers": ["When the grammar of the language is too complex"],
      "incorrectAnswers": ["When there is a need to evaluate complex mathematical formulas", "When handling large amounts of input data", "When the language used is highly structured and static"],
      "explanation": "The Interpreter Design Pattern can become inefficient when the grammar is very complex, as it might result in overly complicated code."

      "question": "Which design pattern is often used alongside the Interpreter Design Pattern to define language expressions more flexibly?",
      "correctAnswers": ["Composite Pattern"],
      "incorrectAnswers": ["Singleton Pattern", "Factory Pattern", "Observer Pattern"],
      "explanation": "The Composite Pattern is often used in conjunction with the Interpreter Design Pattern to allow expressions to be combined and handled hierarchically."

    {
      "question": "What is the key difference between a TerminalExpression and a NonTerminalExpression in the Interpreter Design Pattern?",
      "correctAnswers": ["TerminalExpression evaluates simple values, NonTerminalExpression represents more complex rules"],
      "incorrectAnswers": ["TerminalExpression requires additional context, NonTerminalExpression does not", "TerminalExpression is responsible for parsing, NonTerminalExpression for interpretation", "TerminalExpression evaluates based on user input, NonTerminalExpression does not"],
      "explanation": "TerminalExpression evaluates a basic value, while NonTerminalExpression represents more complex rules or structures that require combining multiple expressions."

    {
      "question": "Which of the following is a disadvantage of using the Interpreter Design Pattern?",
      "correctAnswers": ["It can lead to a large number of classes for complex grammars"],
      "incorrectAnswers": ["It provides a quick execution path for expressions", "It simplifies the implementation of complex expressions", "It reduces memory usage for interpretation"],
      "explanation": "The pattern can become overly complicated when the grammar is complex, leading to a large number of classes and making maintenance difficult."

      "question": "How does the Interpreter Design Pattern evaluate an expression?",
      "correctAnswers": ["By calling the interpret method on each expression object"],
      "incorrectAnswers": ["By interpreting the expression directly in the Context class", "By parsing the expression and executing it sequentially", "By mapping each expression to a predefined rule set"],
      "explanation": "Each expression in the Interpreter Design Pattern has an interpret method that is called to evaluate the expression based on its context."

      "correctAnswers": ["To define how an expression should be evaluated in a specific context"],
      "incorrectAnswers": ["To compile the grammar for all expressions", "To check if the expression is valid before interpretation", "To store the intermediate results of the evaluation"],
      "explanation": "The interpret method in AbstractExpression defines how a specific expression is evaluated in its context."

      "correctAnswers": ["NonTerminalExpression"],

      "incorrectAnswers": ["A parsed representation of the input expression", "The compiled grammar for the expression", "A list of possible interpretations for the expression"],
      "explanation": "The evaluate method is responsible for returning the result of interpreting an expression, typically a value or result based on its context."
