    {
      "question": "Which component is responsible for notifying observers in the observer pattern?",
      "correctAnswers": ["Subject"],
      "incorrectAnswers": ["Observer", "Event", "Listener"],
      "explanation": "The subject is responsible for notifying all registered observers when its state changes."
    },
    {
      "question": "In the observer pattern, which of the following is an example of an observer?",
      "correctAnswers": ["A user interface component that updates based on data changes"],
      "incorrectAnswers": ["A database that stores the data", "A service that processes the data", "A utility class that checks for errors"],
      "explanation": "An observer listens for changes in the subject and updates its state accordingly, like a UI component reflecting data changes."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens when an observer is registered to a subject in the observer pattern?",
      "correctAnswers": ["The observer is added to a list of observers maintained by the subject"],
      "incorrectAnswers": ["The observer starts receiving notifications immediately", "The subject checks if the observer is valid", "The subject creates a new instance of the observer"],
      "explanation": "When an observer is registered, it is added to a list within the subject, and the observer will receive updates when the subject changes."

    {
      "question": "What is the main advantage of using the observer pattern?",
      "correctAnswers": ["It decouples the subject from the observers"],
      "incorrectAnswers": ["It allows the observers to alter the state of the subject", "It improves performance by reducing memory usage", "It makes the subject update automatically without any action"],
      "explanation": "The observer pattern allows for flexibility in communication between components by decoupling the subject from the observers."

      "correctAnswers": ["One-to-many"],
      "incorrectAnswers": ["Many-to-one", "One-to-one", "Many-to-many"],
      "explanation": "The observer pattern defines a one-to-many relationship where one subject notifies multiple observers."

    {
      "question": "How does an observer get notified about state changes in the observer pattern?",
      "correctAnswers": ["By calling an update method on the observer"],
      "incorrectAnswers": ["By polling the subject periodically", "By sending a request to the subject", "By triggering an event on the subject"],
      "explanation": "Observers are notified by the subject calling an update method on each observer when there is a state change."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following is an example of where the observer pattern could be used?",
      "correctAnswers": ["A stock price update system where multiple clients listen for changes in price"],
      "incorrectAnswers": ["A caching system that stores frequently accessed data", "A file system that saves data to disk", "A game engine that handles collision detection"],
      "explanation": "A stock price update system is a perfect example of the observer pattern, as multiple clients listen for changes in the stock price."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which method does an observer typically implement to respond to state changes?",
      "correctAnswers": ["update()"],
      "incorrectAnswers": ["notify()", "receiveUpdate()", "handleChanges()"],
      "explanation": "Observers implement an `update()` method to respond to changes in the subject's state."

    {
      "question": "What is a potential drawback of using the observer pattern in a system?",
      "correctAnswers": ["Observers may not be notified if they are removed from the subject's list unintentionally"],
      "incorrectAnswers": ["Observers will always be notified in the wrong order", "It can lead to memory leaks if observers are not removed", "Subjects will stop functioning after a certain number of observers"],
      "explanation": "If observers are not properly removed or deregistered, it can cause memory leaks and incorrect behavior due to stale references."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of the concrete observer in the observer pattern?",
      "correctAnswers": ["To implement the update method and define the response to state changes"],
      "incorrectAnswers": ["To create a new subject", "To manage multiple observers", "To trigger updates in the subject"],
      "explanation": "Concrete observers implement the `update()` method to handle notifications and update their internal state accordingly."
    },
    {
      "question": "What must a subject do to notify all of its observers in the observer pattern?",
      "correctAnswers": ["Call the update() method on each registered observer"],
      "incorrectAnswers": ["Send a broadcast message to all observers", "Trigger a special event handler in each observer", "Call the notify() method on each observer"],
      "explanation": "The subject must iterate through its list of observers and call the `update()` method on each to notify them of changes."
    },
    {
      "question": "In which scenario would you use the observer pattern to improve your system's design?",
      "correctAnswers": ["When you need to notify many objects about a change without tightly coupling them"],
      "incorrectAnswers": ["When you want to update all objects in a specific order", "When you need objects to directly communicate with each other", "When observers should modify the subject's state"],
      "explanation": "The observer pattern is ideal for notifying many objects about a change in a loosely coupled way, where observers only receive updates without affecting the subject."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does the subject do when it changes state in the observer pattern?",
      "correctAnswers": ["It notifies its observers about the change"],
      "incorrectAnswers": ["It waits for observers to query the state", "It directly updates the observers with new data", "It triggers an event for external listeners"],
      "explanation": "When the state of the subject changes, it notifies its registered observers so they can update accordingly."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the relationship between the observer pattern and event-driven programming?",
      "correctAnswers": ["Both involve communication between components without direct dependencies"],
      "incorrectAnswers": ["They both rely on a single object to control the flow of execution", "Both involve synchronizing the state of components", "They both require observers to alter the subject's behavior"],
      "explanation": "Both patterns facilitate communication between decoupled components, where observers react to events or changes in state."

    {
      "question": "Which of the following best describes the observer pattern's approach to flexibility?",
      "correctAnswers": ["It allows for the addition and removal of observers at runtime"],
      "incorrectAnswers": ["It requires all observers to be known at compile time", "It prevents changes to observers once they are registered", "It uses a fixed number of observers to ensure stability"],
      "explanation": "The observer pattern allows new observers to be added or removed at runtime without affecting the subject's functionality."

      "correctAnswers": ["The observer can unregister itself from the subject"],
      "incorrectAnswers": ["The observer automatically stops receiving updates after a certain period", "The subject must remove the observer on its own", "The observer must change the state of the subject to stop updates"],
      "explanation": "Observers can unregister themselves from the subject when they no longer need updates, preventing unnecessary notifications."

    {
      "question": "Which pattern does the observer pattern support in terms of interaction between components?",
      "correctAnswers": ["Loose coupling"],
      "incorrectAnswers": ["Tight coupling", "Direct communication", "Synchronization of state"],
      "explanation": "The observer pattern promotes loose coupling between the subject and its observers, allowing them to operate independently."

    {
      "question": "In the observer pattern, what is a key characteristic of the subject's behavior?",
      "correctAnswers": ["It does not need to know the details of its observers"],
      "incorrectAnswers": ["It updates all observers immediately in a specific order", "It sends a notification only to a selected few observers", "It must validate the observers before notifying them"],
      "explanation": "The subject only knows that it has observers, not their details, and notifies them without directly interacting with their internal logic."
