		"correctAnswers": ["Linear hierarchy"],
		"incorrectAnswers": ["Cyclic dependency", "Bidirectional association", "Non-hierarchical structure"],
		"explanation": "The Chain of Responsibility pattern demonstrates a linear hierarchy where requests flow from one handler to the next in sequence."
	},
	{
		"question": "In the Chain of Responsibility pattern, how does a handler determine the next step for a request?",

	{
		"question": "What is an advantage of the Chain of Responsibility pattern?",
		"correctAnswers": ["It promotes loose coupling between sender and receivers"],
		"incorrectAnswers": ["It guarantees every handler will process the request", "It enforces strict sequencing of handlers", "It eliminates the need for multiple handlers"],
		"explanation": "The Chain of Responsibility pattern promotes loose coupling by decoupling the sender of a request from its receivers."
	},
	{
		"question": "What happens if no handler processes the request in the Chain of Responsibility pattern?",
		"correctAnswers": ["The request goes unprocessed"],
		"incorrectAnswers": ["The chain restarts from the beginning", "An exception is automatically thrown", "A default handler is always invoked"],
		"explanation": "If no handler in the chain processes the request, it typically remains unprocessed unless a fallback mechanism is explicitly implemented."
	},
	{
		"question": "How can the Chain of Responsibility pattern improve system flexibility?",
		"correctAnswers": ["By allowing handlers to be added or removed dynamically"],
		"incorrectAnswers": ["By centralizing request processing logic", "By using a fixed set of handlers in all scenarios", "By enforcing strict ordering of handler execution"],
		"explanation": "The Chain of Responsibility pattern allows handlers to be added, removed, or rearranged dynamically, making the system more flexible."

	{
		"question": "Which design principle does the Chain of Responsibility pattern follow?",
		"correctAnswers": ["Single Responsibility Principle"],
		"incorrectAnswers": ["Interface Segregation Principle", "Dependency Inversion Principle", "Open/Closed Principle"],
		"explanation": "The Chain of Responsibility pattern adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle by ensuring each handler has a single, focused responsibility."
	},
	{
		"question": "What type of requests are best suited for the Chain of Responsibility pattern?",
		"correctAnswers": ["Requests requiring multiple conditional checks"],
		"incorrectAnswers": ["Requests with strict real-time constraints", "Requests requiring a single processing step", "Requests with guaranteed success handlers"],
		"explanation": "The Chain of Responsibility pattern is well-suited for requests that may require conditional processing by multiple handlers in sequence."
	},
	{
		"question": "What role does a handler play in the Chain of Responsibility pattern?",
		"correctAnswers": ["Processes requests or passes them to the next handler"],
		"incorrectAnswers": ["Manages all requests in the chain", "Coordinates between all handlers in parallel", "Stores the final result of the request"],
		"explanation": "Handlers in the Chain of Responsibility pattern either process requests directly or pass them to the next handler in the chain."
	},
	{
		"question": "What programming construct is commonly used to implement the Chain of Responsibility pattern?",
		"correctAnswers": ["Linked list"],
		"incorrectAnswers": ["Tree structure", "Hash map", "Circular queue"],
		"explanation": "The Chain of Responsibility pattern is often implemented using a linked list, where each node is a handler in the chain."
	},
	{
		"question": "In the Chain of Responsibility pattern, which handler typically processes the request first?",
		"correctAnswers": ["The first handler in the chain"],
		"incorrectAnswers": ["The last handler in the chain", "A randomly selected handler", "The most suitable handler based on priority"],
		"explanation": "The first handler in the chain typically gets the request first and decides whether to process it or pass it along."
	},
	{
		"question": "How does the Chain of Responsibility pattern handle scalability?",
		"correctAnswers": ["By allowing new handlers to be easily added"],
		"incorrectAnswers": ["By requiring the entire chain to be reimplemented", "By limiting the number of handlers to a fixed maximum", "By hardcoding handler relationships"],
		"explanation": "The Chain of Responsibility pattern allows new handlers to be added without significant changes to the existing chain."
	},
	{
		"question": "What is the main drawback of the Chain of Responsibility pattern?",
		"correctAnswers": ["A request might go unprocessed"],
		"incorrectAnswers": ["It increases coupling between sender and handlers", "It enforces a rigid order of execution", "It restricts the number of handlers in the chain"],
		"explanation": "A potential drawback of the Chain of Responsibility pattern is that a request might remain unprocessed if no handler in the chain can handle it."
	},
	{
		"question": "How is the Chain of Responsibility pattern related to polymorphism?",
		"correctAnswers": ["Handlers use polymorphism to process requests"],
		"incorrectAnswers": ["The chain itself is implemented using polymorphism", "It replaces polymorphism with explicit type checks", "Polymorphism is not relevant to this pattern"],
		"explanation": "Handlers in the Chain of Responsibility pattern use polymorphism to determine how to process requests."
	},
	{
		"question": "What is a typical design decision when no handler can process a request?",
		"correctAnswers": ["Logging the unprocessed request"],
		"incorrectAnswers": ["Throwing an exception by default", "Retrying the request automatically", "Returning a success response regardless"],
		"explanation": "If no handler processes a request, a common approach is to log the request for debugging or monitoring purposes."
	},
	{
		"question": "Which pattern is closely related to Chain of Responsibility in its structure?",
		"correctAnswers": ["Decorator pattern"],
		"incorrectAnswers": ["Observer pattern", "Factory pattern", "Builder pattern"],
		"explanation": "The Chain of Responsibility and Decorator patterns share a similar structure, where objects are linked in a sequence, though their purposes differ."
